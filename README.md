Fundamentals of Data Analytics @ ATU 2022

This README contains a summary of various topics within the module, with reference material included for each topic.

Topic 1: Information (Comparisons & Entropy)  

Information theory is a concept of mathematics and statistics based on the work of statistician Claude Shannon in the 1940s.  
Information theory provides data analysts with tools necessary to improve the transmission of telecommunication signals, particularly important in World War II where Roosevelt & Churchill could communicate.  
Shannon suggested and coined that the randomly generated text can represent far more information compared to the traditional Alice in Wonderland paragraph, which must follow distinct rules of the English language and is therefore restricted.    
The word entropy refers to scenarios with less organisation, control and less constraints/restrictions.  
The term was coined by German physicist Rudolf Clausius for his work in thermodynamics, where entropy can measure the amount of information in a variable.  
In information theory, the entropy of a random variable is defined as the average level of uncertainty in possible outcomes stemming from the random variable.

Topic 2: Randomness (Coin Flips, Counting Heads & Distributions)  

The word random refers to outcomes that are deemed to be unexpected.  
In data analytics, randomness is focussed on its relationship to variation and expectation in events.  
In this notebook, we will look at flipping coins and resulting probabilities, as well as plotting distributions.

Topic 3: Bias (Cognitive Bias, Statistical Bias, Standard Deviation)  

Bias is a mindset where we as humans will have our biases, which are influenced by our cultural, societal and personal experiences.  
In this notebook, we will analyse cognitive biases in human mindsets as well as statistical biases influenced by the mean and standard deviation values.

Topic 4: Outliers (Scaling, Exponent, Percentiles, Quartiles)  

In data analytics, outliers are values in datasets which majorly vary from others, being either significantly larger or smaller than the mean.  
Outliers can be there to indicate to analysts any measuremental or experimental errors in datasets.  
Outliers can negatively impact analytical results, but can be information that analysts are searching for in order to understand trends in datasets.

Topic 5: Cleansing (Regular Expressions)  

Data cleansing is used to identify errors, duplicates and unrelated data points in datasets in order to fix them.  
Cleansing is a part of preparing data, it allows analysts to create more reliable models and visualisations to make better business decisions.
